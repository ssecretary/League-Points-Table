# League Points Table

The **League Points Table** is an application where users can log in or register, add teams with their respective points, and view the league table sorted by points in descending order. This application is built using Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend, with MongoDB used as the database.

## 📝 Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can log in or register to access the application.
- **Add Teams**: After login, users can add teams along with their corresponding points to the league table.
- **View League Table**: The application displays a points table with teams listed in descending order based on their points.
